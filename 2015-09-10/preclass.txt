1. Look up the specs for the totient nodes. Having read the Roofline paper,
   draw a roofline diagram for one totient node (assuming only the
   host cores are used, for the moment).  How do things change with
   the addition of the two Phi boards?

307 Gigaflops
Peak Memory transfer rate: 307/59 = 5.203

Graph code (pseudocode)
plot(1:5.203,1:5.203)
hold on
plot(5.203:100,5.203:100)

2. What is the difference between two cores and one core with
   hyperthreading?

One core with hyperthreading simulates two cores. However, two cores are physically
distinct and have their own caches and so on.

3. Do a Google search to find a picture of how memories are arranged
   on the Phi architecture.  Describe the setup briefly in your own
   words.  Is the memory access uniform or non-uniform?

There are eight cores

It is not uniform because processor memory is stored on specific processor packages.

4. Consider the parallel dot product implementations suggested in the
   slides.  As a function of the number of processors, the size of the
   vectors, and typical time to send a message, can you predict the
   speedup associated with parallelizing a dot product computation?
   [Note that dot products have low arithmetic intensity -- the
    roofline model may be useful for reasoning about the peak
    performance for computing pieces of the dot product]

Speedup will not help that much because the results still must be summed at the end
/ Because of the low arithmetic intencity
