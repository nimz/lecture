## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process
 - Time to compute row counts
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic

Consider the following questions:

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?
Time to start the process: a
Time to compute row counts: b*n, where n is the max number of students in a row
Time to gather counts: c*m, where m is the number of rows
Time to do arithmetic: d*m, where m is the number of rows
Total time: a + bn + cm + dm = a + bn + (c+d)m: O(m+n)
2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?
Time to count students: b*m*n, where all defined as before
3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?
We would need a + bn + (c+d)m < bmn
(size of class is mn)
